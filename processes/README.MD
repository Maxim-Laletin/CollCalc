Process files are created by the user in the same fashion as some examples here. These files should necessarily contain four masses of the particles in the reaction (in GeV units), the corresponding spin types (bosons, fermions or spinless particles with the MB statistics) and the M-squared function of two variables: s and t (in units GeV^2).
